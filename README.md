# Elastron

Desktop Elasticsearch client.

The project is NOT actively maintained. It has bugs, smelling code, and ugly code formatting. ðŸ¤“

So, please, feel free to create issues, PRs, and maybe I will find some time to keep this project alive.

### Install

yarn
```

```sh
yarn build
```

Development in browser: (no interaction with real elastic server)

```

Development preview as an app:

App build:

yarn dist #for all
```
